#' single-cell gene expression in mouse fibroblasts and embryonic stem cells (islam).
#'
#' The Islam dataset considers $44$ embryonic fibroblasts and $48$ embryonic stem cells in mouse. The original dataset was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) with accession number GSE29087. Control wells and genes with positive counts in fewer than 5 cells were removed.
